How to build
------------

Unix:
  make lib   -> Builds the bin/cl2.a static library
  make       -> Builds the bin/cl2 standalone interpreter

Windows/Other:
  To build the standalone interpreter, add all *.cpp 
  file in the src directory into a project and compile.
  To build a library, exclude test.cpp in the build.

Sorry, no docs yet :(
